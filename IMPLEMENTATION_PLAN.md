## Current Work

**Completed:** Phase 1 - Preparation complete with:
- HarnessAdapter interface and types
- HarnessRegistry with ClaudeAdapter registered
- `asp harnesses` command
- `--harness` flag on all CLI commands (run, install, build, explain)

**Completed:** Phase 2 - Two-Phase Materialization
- ClaudeAdapter output path now returns harness subdirectory (`asp_modules/<target>/claude`)
- Harness-aware cache key function added
- Lock file types and schema updated with harness entries
- Harness-aware path helpers added to core package
- Engine files (install.ts, build.ts, run.ts) migrated to use harness adapters
- `--harness` flag added to install, build, and explain commands
- Harness entries generated in lock file during resolution (with harness-specific envHash)
- Added `computeHarnessEnvHash()` function in resolver/integrity.ts

**Completed:** Phase 3 - Pi Support
- Created `packages/engine/src/harness/pi-adapter.ts` with full HarnessAdapter implementation
- Pi binary detection: PI_PATH env → PATH → ~/tools/pi-mono
- Extension bundling with Bun: bundles .ts/.js to namespaced .js files
- Hook bridge generation: creates asp-hooks.bridge.js that shells out to scripts
- Model translation: sonnet → claude-sonnet, opus → claude-opus, etc.
- Skills directory merging (Agent Skills standard - same as Claude)
- Pi-specific lint rules:
  - W301: Warning for blocking hooks that Pi cannot enforce
  - W302: Warning code constant added (full AST analysis deferred to future work)
  - W303: Extension file collision detection during composition
- Warning code cleanup: Renamed LOCK_MISSING from W301 to W101 to reserve W3xx for harness-specific warnings

**Completed:** Phase 4.1 - AGENT.md Support
- Added `linkInstructionsFile()` helper function in materializer
- ClaudeAdapter.materializeSpace() now links AGENT.md → CLAUDE.md (or CLAUDE.md → CLAUDE.md for legacy)
- PiAdapter.materializeSpace() now links AGENT.md → AGENT.md
- Backwards compatible: legacy CLAUDE.md still works for Claude-only spaces
- Added 9 tests for instructions file handling

**Completed:** Phase 4.2 - hooks.toml Support
- Created `packages/materializer/src/hooks-toml.ts` for parsing canonical hooks format
- hooks.toml is the harness-agnostic format, translated to harness-specific formats:
  - Claude: generates `hooks/hooks.json` with Claude event names (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop)
  - Pi: reads via `readHooksWithPrecedence()` for hook bridge generation
- `readHooksWithPrecedence()` prefers hooks.toml over hooks.json for backwards compatibility
- Event mapping: pre_tool_use → PreToolUse (Claude) / tool_call (Pi), etc.
- harness-specific hooks: `harness = "pi"` or `harness = "claude"` field filters hooks
- Added 27 tests for hooks.toml parsing and generation

**Completed:** Phase 4.3 - permissions.toml Support
- Created `packages/materializer/src/permissions-toml.ts` for parsing permissions.toml
- permissions.toml is the harness-agnostic format with sections: [read], [write], [exec], [network], [deny]
- Enforcement levels classify how each harness handles permissions:
  - Claude: read/write/exec/deny → enforced; network → lint_only
  - Pi: exec → best_effort; everything else → lint_only
- ClaudeAdapter reads permissions.toml from artifacts and merges with settings during composition
- PiAdapter reads permissions.toml and generates W304 warnings for lint_only facets
- Added W304 warning code: PI_PERMISSION_LINT_ONLY
- Added 51 tests for permissions.toml parsing and translation

**Completed:** Phase 5.1 - Test Fixtures Setup
- Created `integration-tests/fixtures/multi-harness/` with:
  - `claude-only/` - Space with commands, MCP, and skills
  - `pi-only/` - Space with extensions and skills
  - `multi-harness/` - Space with AGENT.md, commands, extensions, hooks.toml, permissions.toml, skills
  - `multi-harness-project/` - Project with asp-targets.toml targeting all spaces

**Completed:** Phase 5.2 - Claude Harness Smoke Tests
- Fixed engine (install.ts) to use harness adapter's `materializeSpace()` instead of direct `materializeSpaces()` call
- This enables hooks.toml → hooks.json conversion during Claude materialization
- Updated `validateHooks()` and `ensureHooksExecutable()` to handle both hook formats:
  - Simple format: `{hooks: [{event, script}]}`
  - Claude native format: `{hooks: [{matcher, hooks: [{command}]}]}`
- Updated `readHooksWithPrecedence()` to parse Claude's native hooks.json format for backwards compatibility
- Fixed explain.ts to handle both hook formats without type errors
- Removed Phase 1 restrictions from CLI commands (pi harness now accessible)
- Verified hooks.toml conversion with smoke test: `pre_tool_use` → `PreToolUse`, scripts prefixed with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/`

**Next:** Phase 5.3-5.10 - Additional Smoke Testing
- Pi harness smoke tests (requires pi binary)
- Multi-harness target tests
- Manual testing of remaining scenarios

---

## Phase 5: Multi-Harness Smoke Testing

Manual smoke testing of multi-harness configurations using actual harnesses in non-interactive mode.

### 5.1 Test Fixtures Setup ✅
- [x] Create `integration-tests/fixtures/multi-harness/` directory
- [x] Create Claude-only space (`claude-only/`) with commands, MCP, skills
- [x] Create Pi-only space (`pi-only/`) with extensions, skills
- [x] Create multi-harness space (`multi-harness/`) with AGENT.md, skills, hooks, permissions.toml
- [x] Create project with `asp-targets.toml` targeting all three spaces

### 5.2 Claude Harness Smoke Tests ✅
Run each with `--dry-run` first, then with actual `claude` binary using `--print` (non-interactive):

- [x] Basic Claude run: `asp run claude-target --harness claude --dry-run`
- [x] Verify `--plugin-dir` flags point to `asp_modules/<target>/claude/plugins/`
- [x] Verify `--settings` points to composed `settings.json`
- [x] Verify hooks.toml → hooks.json conversion works correctly
- [ ] Test with `--inherit-project` / `--inherit-user` flags (manual testing)
- [ ] Test with explicit `--model` override (manual testing)
- [ ] Verify AGENT.md → CLAUDE.md renaming in output (manual testing)
- [ ] Run `asp explain <target> --harness claude` and verify output (manual testing)

Non-interactive execution (requires Claude):
```bash
echo "What tools do you have?" | asp run <target> --harness claude --print
```

**Key fixes completed during Phase 5.2:**
1. Fixed engine (install.ts) to use harness adapter's `materializeSpace()` for hooks.toml→hooks.json conversion
2. Updated `validateHooks()` to handle both simple format and Claude's native hooks.json format
3. Updated `ensureHooksExecutable()` to work with both hook formats
4. Updated `readHooksWithPrecedence()` to parse Claude's native hooks.json format
5. Fixed explain.ts to handle both hook formats without type errors
6. Removed Phase 1 restrictions from CLI commands (pi harness now accessible)

### 5.3 Pi Harness Smoke Tests
Run each with `--dry-run` first, then with actual `pi` binary using non-interactive mode:

- [ ] Basic Pi run: `asp run pi-target --harness pi --dry-run`
- [ ] Verify `--extension` flags point to bundled `.js` files
- [ ] Verify extensions are namespaced (`<spaceId>__<name>.js`)
- [ ] Verify `--skills` points to merged skills directory
- [ ] Verify hook bridge extension (`asp-hooks.bridge.js`) is generated
- [ ] Verify model translation (`sonnet` → `claude-sonnet`)
- [ ] Test with explicit `--model` override
- [ ] Verify AGENT.md is copied (not renamed) for Pi
- [ ] Run `asp explain <target> --harness pi` and verify output

Non-interactive execution (requires Pi):
```bash
echo "What tools do you have?" | asp run <target> --harness pi --print
```

### 5.4 Multi-Harness Target Tests
Project with `harnesses = ["claude", "pi"]` in target config:

- [ ] `asp install` generates both `asp_modules/<target>/claude/` and `asp_modules/<target>/pi/`
- [ ] `asp build --harness claude` builds only Claude output
- [ ] `asp build --harness pi` builds only Pi output
- [ ] `asp build` builds both (if target declares both)
- [ ] Lock file contains `harnesses` section with per-harness `envHash`
- [ ] Verify warnings in lock file (e.g., W301 for blocking hooks on Pi)

### 5.5 AGENT.md / CLAUDE.md Handling
- [ ] Space with only `AGENT.md`: Claude output has `CLAUDE.md`, Pi output has `AGENT.md`
- [ ] Space with only `CLAUDE.md`: Claude output has `CLAUDE.md`, Pi output is empty (or warns)
- [ ] Space with both: Claude prefers `CLAUDE.md`, Pi uses `AGENT.md`
- [ ] Verify `asp explain` shows instructions file handling

### 5.6 Skills Directory Handling
- [ ] Single space with skills: skills copied to both harness outputs
- [ ] Multiple spaces with skills: skills merged in load order
- [ ] Skill collision handling (later space overwrites earlier)

### 5.7 Hooks Handling
- [ ] Space with `hooks/hooks.json`: Claude uses directly, Pi generates bridge
- [ ] Verify hook scripts are executable in output
- [ ] Verify Pi hook bridge has correct event mappings
- [ ] Verify W301 warning for blocking hooks on Pi

### 5.8 Extension Bundling (Pi)
- [ ] TypeScript extension bundles to `.js`
- [ ] Extension with dependencies bundles correctly
- [ ] `[pi.build]` options respected (format, target, external)
- [ ] Bundle includes correct namespacing wrapper

### 5.9 Error Cases
- [ ] `--harness pi` on Claude-only space: clear error message
- [ ] `--harness claude` on Pi-only space: clear error message
- [ ] Missing harness binary: helpful error with installation guidance
- [ ] Extension bundling failure: clear error with path and details

### 5.10 CLI Command Coverage
Test each CLI command with `--harness` flag:

- [ ] `asp run <target> --harness <id> --dry-run`
- [ ] `asp install --harness <id>`
- [ ] `asp build <target> --harness <id>`
- [ ] `asp explain <target> --harness <id>`
- [ ] `asp harnesses` (list available harnesses)
- [ ] `asp harnesses --json` (JSON output)

---

## Notes and Learnings

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Each harness implements a common interface for detection, validation, materialization, composition, and invocation.

2. **Two-Phase Materialization**: Per-space artifacts are cached independently, then composed per-target. This enables cache reuse across projects.

3. **Harness-Specific Dependencies**: Spaces can declare harness-specific dependencies that only apply when composing for that harness.

4. **Backwards Compatibility**: Phase 1 introduces no breaking changes. Existing Claude-only workflows continue to work unchanged.

5. **ClaudeAdapter Wrapping**: The ClaudeAdapter wraps existing functionality from @agent-spaces/claude and @agent-spaces/materializer rather than duplicating it.

6. **Harness EnvHash Design**: The harness-specific `envHash` in lock files includes the harness ID but NOT the harness version. This is intentional because:
   - Version changes independently of space content
   - Actual materialization cache uses `computeHarnessPluginCacheKey()` which includes version
   - Lock file hash is for "resolved environment identity" not "materialized artifact identity"

7. **Warning Code Organization**:
   - W1xx: System/project-level warnings (W101: lock file missing)
   - W2xx: Space/plugin lint rules (W201-W207: command collisions, hooks issues, etc.)
   - W3xx: Harness-specific warnings (W301-W310 reserved for Pi)
