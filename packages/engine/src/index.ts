/**
 * @agent-spaces/engine - High-level orchestration for Agent Spaces v2.
 *
 * WHY: This package provides high-level entrypoints that coordinate
 * the resolver, store, materializer, claude, and lint packages.
 *
 * The engine is the primary interface for:
 * - Installing (resolving + populating store)
 * - Building (materializing to plugin directories)
 * - Running (launching Claude with plugins)
 * - Explaining (debugging resolution)
